# Backend and frontend of our graduation project website

### Notes
* React is proxied to work under the localhost machine, i.e. if the backend and the front end are on different machines, you'll get a googoo. Keep this in mind if you want to scale this up to multiple machines
* This was built for a heroku backend
* To run this you need to make a python envionrnment and install all requirment.txt packages
* To run this you need to install NPM and all node modules in ui/package.json
